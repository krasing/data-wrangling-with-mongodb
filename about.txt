Evaluation

A Udacity evaluator will review and check your completion of problem set 6 in Data Wrangling with MongoDB, as well as your answers to the questions listed in the rubric.

Be sure to complete all of questions in the problem set and the rubric before submitting your project.

Rubric

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to this project rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. Your "project meets specifications" if it meets specifications in all the criteria

Submission

Ready to submit your project? Collect the following files:

A pdf document containing your answers to the rubric questions. This file should document your data wrangling process.
Your Python code for Lesson 6 quizzes, as well as any additional code you used in auditing and cleaning your dataset for the final project.
A text file containing a link to the map position you wrangled in your project, a short description of the area and a reason for your choice.
An .osm file containing a sample part of the map region you used (around 1 - 10 MB in size). See instructor notes.
A text file containing a list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc that you referred to or used in this submission (Add N/A if you did not use such resources).

How do I Complete this Project?

This project is connected to the Data Wrangling with MongoDB course, but depending on your background knowledge of data wrangling, you may not need to take the whole thing to complete this project.

Here's what you should do:

Step One - Finish Lesson 6

Make sure all Lesson 6 programming exercises are solved correctly.

Step Two - Review the Rubric and Sample Project

The Project Rubric will be used to evaluate your project. It will need to Meet Specifications for all the criteria listed. The Sample Project is an example of what your final report could look like.

Step Three - Choose Your Map Area

Choose any area of the world from https://www.openstreetmap.org , and download a XML OSM dataset. The dataset should be at least 50MB in size (uncompressed). We recommend using one of following methods of downloading a dataset:

Download a preselected metro area from Map Zen (Note that data obtained from Map Zen is compressed and will usually expand to sizes that meet project requirements.)
https://mapzen.com/metro-extracts/
Use the Overpass API to download a custom square area. Explanation of the syntax can found in the wiki . 
http://overpass-api.de/query_form.html
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API
In general you will want to use the following query: (node(minimum_latitude, minimum_longitude, maximum_latitude, maximum_longitude);<;);out meta; e.g. (node(51.249,7.148,51.251,7.152);<;);out meta; the meta option is included so the elements contain timestamp and user information. You can use the Open Street Map Export Tool to find the coordinates of your bounding box. Note: You will not be able to use the Export Tool to actually download the data, the area required for this project is too large.

Step Four - Process your Dataset

Thoroughly audit and clean your dataset, converting it from XML to JSON format. It is recommended that you start with the Lesson 6 exercises and modify them to suit your chosen data set. As you unravel the data, take note of problems encountered along the way as well as issues with the dataset. You are going to need these when you write your project report. Finally, import the clean JSON file into a MongoDB database and run some queries against it.

Step Five - Document your Work

Create a document (pdf, html) that directly addresses the following sections from the Project Rubric .

Problems encountered in your map
Overview of the Data
Other ideas about the datasets
Try to include snippets of code and problematic tags (see Sample Project) and visualizations in your report if they are applicable.
